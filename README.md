# Parking-Ticket_GIF-generator

This purpose of this script is to read raw data from the City of Toronto's open source parking data (found here: http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=ca20256c54ea4310VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=1a66e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD) and generate a map of downtown Toronto showing parking tickets using a heat and dot density map layer.
